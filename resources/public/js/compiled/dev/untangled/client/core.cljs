(defn new-untangled-client
  "Entrypoint for creating a new untangled client. Instantiates an Application with default values, unless
  overridden by the parameters. If you do not supply a networking object, one will be provided that connects to the
  same server the application was served from, at `/api`.

  If you supply a `:request-transform` it must be a function:

  ```
 (fn [edn headers] [edn' headers'])
  ```

  it can replace the outgoing EDN or headers (returning both as a vector). NOTE: Both of these are clojurescript types.
  The edn will be encoded with transit, and the headers will be converted to a js map.

  `:initial-state` is your applications initial state. If it is an atom, it *must* be normalized. Untangled databases
  always have normalization turned on (for server data merging). If it is not an atom, it will be auto-normalized.

  `:started-callback` is an optional function that will receive the intiailized untangled application after it is
  mounted in the DOM, and is useful for triggering initial loads, routing mutations, etc. The Om reconciler is available
  under the `:reconciler` key (and you can access the app state, root node, etc from there.)

  `:network-error-callback` is a function of two arguments, the app state atom and the error, which will be invoked for
  every network error (status code >= 400, or no network found), should you choose to use the built-in networking record.

  `:migrate` is optional. It is a (fn [state tid->rid] ... state') that should return a new state where all tempids
  (the keys of `tid->rid`) are rewritten to real ids (the values of tid->rid). This defaults to a full recursive
  algorithm against all data in the app-state, which is correct but possibly slow).  Note that tempids will have an Om tempid data type.
  See Om reconciler documentation for further information.

  There is currently no way to circumvent the encoding of the body into transit. If you want to talk to other endpoints
  via alternate protocols you must currently implement that outside of the framework (e.g. global functions/state).
