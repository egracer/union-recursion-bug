(defn load-field
  "Load a field of the current component. Runs `om/transact!`.

  Parameters
  - `component`: The component
  - `field`: A field on the current component's query that you wish to load
  - `without`: Named parameter for excluding child keys from the query (e.g. for recursive queries or additional laziness)
  - `params`: Named parameter for adding params to the query sent to the server for this field.
  - `post-mutation`: A mutation (symbol) invoked after the load succeeds.
  - `parallel`: Boolean to indicate that this load should happen in the parallel on the server (non-blocking load). Any loads marked this way will happen in parallel.
  - `fallback`: A mutation (symbol) invoked after the load fails. App state is in env, server error in the params under :error.
  - `refresh`: A vector of keywords indicating data that will be changing. If any of the listed keywords are queried by on-screen
    components, then those components will be re-rendered after the load has finished and post mutations have run. Note
    that for load-field the ident of the target component is automatically included, so this parametmer is usually not
    needed. If the *special* key `:untangled/force-root` is used in the vector (it must always be a vector), then the entire
    app will be re-rendered. This is discouraged since it is highly inefficient and should be easily avoidable. It is mainly included
    in case some re-render bug in Om or Untangled pops up and needs a temporary workaround.

  NOTE: The :ui/loading-data attribute is always included in refresh. This means you probably don't want to
  query for that attribute near the root of your UI. Instead, create some leaf component with an ident that queries for :ui/loading-data
  using an Om link (e.g. `[:ui/loading-data '_]`). The presence of the ident on components will enable query optimization, which can
  improve your frame rate because Om will not have to run a full root query.

(defn load-data
  "Load data from the remote. Runs `om/transact!`. See also `load-field`.

  Parameters
  - `comp-or-reconciler`: A component or reconciler (not a class)
  - `query`: The query for the element(s) attributes. Use defui to generate arbitrary queries so normalization will work.
  - Named parameter `ident`: An ident, used if loading a singleton and you wish to specify 'which one'.
  - `post-mutation`: A mutation (symbol) invoked after the load succeeds.
  - `fallback`: A mutation (symbol) invoked after the load fails. App state is in env, server error is in the params under :error.
  - `parallel`: Boolean to indicate that this load should happen in the parallel on the server (non-blocking load). Any loads marked this way will happen in parallel.
  - `refresh`: A vector of keywords indicating data that will be changing. If any of the listed keywords are queried by on-screen
    components, then those components will be re-rendered after the load has finished and post mutations have run.

  Named parameters `:without` and `:params` are as in `load-field`.

(defn lazily-loaded
  "Custom rendering for use while data is being lazily loaded using the data fetch methods
  load-collection and load-field.

  `data-render` : the render method to call once the data has been successfully loaded from
  the server. Can be an Om factory method or a React rendering function.

  `props` : the React properties for the element to be loaded.

  Optional:

  `ready-render` : the render method to call when the desired data has been marked as ready
  to load, but the server request has not yet been sent.

  `loading-render` : render method once the server request has been sent, and UI is waiting
  on the response

  `failed-render` : render method when the server returns a failure state for the requested data
  ALPHA WARNING: The transfer of read errors to failed data states is not implemented in this alpha version.

  `not-present-render` : called when props is nil (helpful for differentiating between a nil and
  empty response from the server).

  Example Usage:

  ```
